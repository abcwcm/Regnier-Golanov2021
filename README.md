# Scripts for the analysis of RNA-seq data for Regnier-Golanov et. al (2021)

See the methods file ([Rmd](methods.Rmd) or [PDF](https://github.com/abcwcm/Regnier-Golanov2021/blob/main/methods.pdf)) for a **verbose summary** of the steps we took to process and analyze the bulk RNA-seq data supporting the manuscript by Regnier-Golanov et al. (2021).

<preprocessing/makefile> contains all details about the preprocessing, including read alignment and count matrix generation.
For details of the differential gene expression analysis, see <deseq2_analysis/golanov_deseq2.Rmd>.

All scripts were written by Paul Zumbo and Friederike DÃ¼ndar.

Don't hesitate to [get in touch](https://abc.med.cornell.edu/) with questions related to the code.
